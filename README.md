# URL Shortener Microservice

This project is a RESTful API for exercise tracking. Users can create an account, log exercises they have done, and view their exercise history. The API also includes optional query parameters for filtering exercise logs.

## API Endpoints

The API has the following endpoints:

- `POST /api/users`: creates a new user account
- `GET /api/users`: retrieves a list of all users
- `POST /api/users/:id/exercises`: logs a new exercise for a specific user
- `GET /api/users/:id/logs`: retrieves the exercise history for a specific user. The exercise logs can be filtered using the following optional query parameters:
  - `from`: Retrieve exercises starting from this date (YYYY-MM-DD)
  - `to`: Retrieve exercises up to and including this date (YYYY-MM-DD)
  - `limit`: Limit the number of exercises returned

## Technologies Used

- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB
- Docker
